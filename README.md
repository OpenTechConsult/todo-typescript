# Todo List App

A todo application written in typescript. The application is a command line application.
The application will display list of tasks, allow new tasks to be created, and allow existing tasks to be marked as completed. There will also be a filter to include already completed tasks in the list.

The application will also add support for storing data persistently so that changes are not lost when the application is terminated.
